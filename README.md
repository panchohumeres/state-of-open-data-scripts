# Files:

Descriptive stats for all the resources (datasets) published in datos.gob.cl, the Chilean Government official Open Data Portal, based on open-source software [CKAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKAN). Datasets metadata has been extracted using [CKAN's official API, v3](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/). 
A Dashboard Demo built with Kibana, for visualizing these stats can be accesed at: http://www.estado.datos.gob.cl.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/. You can access the Jupyter Notebook version [here](https://anaconda.org/fhumeres/ckan_stats/notebook)
